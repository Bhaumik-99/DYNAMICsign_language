# DYNAMICsign_language 🤟

DYNAMICsign_language is a project focused on dynamic sign language recognition using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The repository aims to provide tools and models for real-time or video-based sign language recognition, making communication more accessible for the hearing and speech impaired community.

## Features ✨

- Real-Time Recognition 📹: Detects and interprets dynamic sign language gestures from video input.
- Data Preprocessing & Augmentation 🛠️: Tools for preparing and enhancing sign language datasets.
- Deep Learning Models 🧠: Supports gesture and sign detection with models like ResNet.
- Evaluation & Visualization 📊: Includes metrics and tools for performance analysis.
- Modular Codebase 🧩: Extensible for research and development.

## Dataset  📂
We have created a custom dataset for training the models, consisting of **300–500 videos per word** across a total of **5 dynamic sign language words**. All videos were self-recorded specifically for this project, ensuring diverse and representative gesture samples for each sign.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

You may need the following libraries (install via pip if not present):

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow keras matplotlib
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhaumik-99/DYNAMICsign_language.git
   cd DYNAMICsign_language
   ```
2. Install the required packages (see above).

### Usage

- To **interact with the sign language recognition system**, run the application script:

```bash
python app.py
```
